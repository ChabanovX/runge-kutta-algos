# Practical Tasks

## Variant 1

### 1. Write a Computer Program that Solves

#### a) 
Solve the differential equation:
\[
y' = x + \cos(y), \quad y(1) = 30, \quad 1 \leq x \leq 2
\]

#### b)
Solve the differential equation:
\[
y' = x^2 + y^2, \quad y(2) = 1, \quad 1 \leq x \leq 2
\]

Implement in the code numerical Runge-Kutta explicit methods of 2nd and 4th order with grid steps:
- \( h = 0.1 $
- \( h = 0.05 \)
- \( h = 0.01 \)
- \( h = 0.005 \)
- \( h = 0.001 \)

For each numerical method, compose four arrays of the relative errors for the numbers \( N = 20, 100, 200, 1000 \) at the same \( x \) coordinates:

- \( N = 20: \quad |x_k(n_{20}) - x_k(n_{10})|, \quad k = 1,10 \)
- \( N = 100: \quad |x_k(n_{100}) - x_k(n_{20})|, \quad k = 1,10 \)
- \( N = 200: \quad |x_k(n_{200}) - x_k(n_{100})|, \quad k = 1,10 \)
- \( N = 1000: \quad |x_k(n_{1000}) - x_k(n_{200})|, \quad k = 1,10 \)

Provide the functionality of printing the arrays of the relative errors onto the console in the format:

- In the first line, print the title of the array (e.g., "N_20"),
- In the second line, print the values stored in the array, separated by spaces, without the space after the last item.

For each numerical method, compose the array of the absolute errors:

\[
\max(|x_k(n_{N2}) - x_k(n_{N1})|)
\]

Provide the functionality of plotting \( \log_2 \) of the absolute errors of both methods together in one picture.

### 2. Write a Computer Program that Solves

Solve the second-order differential equation:
\[
y'' = y \sin(x), \quad y(0) = 0, \quad y'(0) = 1, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1
\]
